## Who's Paying

# Instructions

You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill. 

**Important**: You are not allowed to use the `choice()` function.

**Line 8** splits the string `names_string` into individual names and puts them inside a **List** called `names`. For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

# Example Input

```
Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
```
Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name. 
# Example Output

```
Michael is going to buy the meal today!
```


# Hint

1. You might need the help of the `len()` function.

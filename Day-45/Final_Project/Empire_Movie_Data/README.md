**Description** : This project is a very excitingg project for me as I'm a movie aficionado. This is a very simple web scraping application which scrapes data from [Esquire website](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/g226/best-movies-ever-0609/) listing all 100 movies of all time. After getting the movies titles I store it in a text file so I can delete movies from it when I watch some of them from the list :clapper:

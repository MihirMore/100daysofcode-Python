### Day - 1
**Thoughts** : Started out with the 100 days of code [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Angela. Already knew some basics of python and was a nice refresher. Day 1 includes print, input statements and string manipulation. Also, did the practice exercises on [repl.it](https://replit.com/~). The projectt on day-1 encompasses all the concepts taught before and has set a starting point. Today I also studied some freecodecamp [python lectures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) by Prof. Charles Severence. 

### Day - 2
**Thoughts** : Today I learned about data types, mathematical operations and some string manipulation and f strings. Build a BMI calculator and life in weeks(a slightly dark project) program. The project of the day was Tip calculator which also takes in account what percent of bill you want to tip. Also practiced some python exercises from [Pynative](https://pynative.com/python-basic-exercise-for-beginners/) which tested some the concepts I learned earlier.

### Day - 3
**Thoughts** : Angela started with control flow with if-else loops and went on to practice abundant exercises. Learnt more about nested if-else loops, updated yesterday's BMI calculator. Also developed Pizza Order prize calculator and love calculator based on Buzzfeed's [article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ariannarebolini/what-are-the-chances-your-crush-is-actually-your-true-love). And then went on to develop the treasure island project which includes nice ascii art.

### Day - 4
**Thoughts** : Learned about Random function today in Python. Did you knew that python uses Mersenne Twister behind the scenes for random function, Interesting! [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) it's wiki. Build some easy yet fun exercises like head-tails game, banker's roulette which is an interesting game among the indigeneous London bankers. Finally, created a rock, paper, scissor game which has ascii art and random choice by computer. 

### Day - 5
**Thoughts** : Day-5 started with loops in python, particularly for loops. The first exercise was for calculating average height using for loop. The next exercise was based on range function of for loops which was to calculate even numbers addition. Angela introduced an interview question FizzBuzz which I found out to be relatively easy. Finally, created a random password generator which takes input for characters, numbers and special symbols. Finally, concluded the day with some light practice freom [w3 resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php) for python.  

### Day - 6
**Thoughts** : Today started by learning about creating, defining and calling *functions*. The first exercise was hurdles in [reeborg's world](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html). Thsese are a set of fascinating exercise which will test and help you with learning loops and functions in python. Then learned about while loops in python and did 2 more exercises on reeborg's world. The final project is about navigating reeborg along a maze with some conditions and actions to be performed. Also tested some edge cases where the code fails and fixed it with some help from Angela.

### Day - 7
**Thoughts** : Day - 7 exercises were different as compared to earlier day's exercises. On day 7 we built a *hangman* game and go on building it in steps; essentially breaking a bigger problem into finite easier exercises. Hangman game is a very good tester project to gauge the skills learned so far. Hangman game is an exciting game which also includes ascii art. :heart:

### Day - 8 
**Thoughts** : Started out with functions with inputs and learned what are arguments and parameters are. The exercises are awesome like paint can calculator and prime number checker. Then started with caesar cipher implementation. The encryption and decryption part is exciting and how we merge both into a single function. :godmode: Today was a 7/10 productive day, also walked 15,000 steps.:sunglasses:

### Day - 9
**Thoughts** : Today's day started with deep dive into the workings of dictionaries. Then created a grading program which applied the concept of dictionaries. Learned a very intriguing concept about list in dictionaries and dictionaries in list and nesting lists and dictionaries. Developed a silent auction program using the concepts of dictionaries and lists :sparkles: 

### Day - 10
**Thoughts** : Learned about return statements in functions and how multiple return statements work. Coded a nice days in months exercise and learned about docstrings. Also discussed about print vs return statement and also about while loops, recursion and flags. Final project developed was calculator which included all th concepts used taught :heart_eyes:

### Day - 11
**Thoughts** : Day - 11 culminated in the first capstone project of the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) 
which tested all the concepts covered till now and building blackjack project was quite fun :boom: This is where the hard-work starts to pay off and when you nail it you'll be elated by how much you have achieved :sunglasses:

### Day - 12
**Thoughts** : Today I learnt about scopes in Python. Local scope and Global scopes makes a lot of difference if you are creating a complex code and want to maintain flow. This is very useful as you can assign all the global variables in the beginning and just code on. After that developed today's project which is a number guessing game. Today was a productive day! :innocent:

## 100 days of code (Python) adventures

### Day - 1
**Thoughts** : Started out with the 100 days of code [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Angela. Already knew some basics of python and was a nice refresher. Day 1 includes print, input statements and string manipulation. Also, did the practice exercises on [repl.it](https://replit.com/~). The projectt on day-1 encompasses all the concepts taught before and has set a starting point. Today I also studied some freecodecamp [python lectures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) by Prof. Charles Severence. 

### Day - 2
**Thoughts** : Today I learned about data types, mathematical operations and some string manipulation and f strings. Build a BMI calculator and life in weeks(a slightly dark project) program. The project of the day was Tip calculator which also takes in account what percent of bill you want to tip. Also practiced some python exercises from [Pynative](https://pynative.com/python-basic-exercise-for-beginners/) which tested some the concepts I learned earlier.

## 100 days of code (Python) adventures

### Day - 1
**Thoughts** : Started out with the 100 days of code [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Angela. Already knew some basics of python and was a nice refresher. Day 1 includes print, input statements and string manipulation. Also, did the practice exercises on [repl.it](https://replit.com/~). The projectt on day-1 encompasses all the concepts taught before and has set a starting point. Today I also studied some freecodecamp [python lectures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) by Prof. Charles Severence.

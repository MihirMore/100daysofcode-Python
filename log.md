## 100 days of code (Python) adventures

### Day - 1
**Thoughts** : Started out with the 100 days of code [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Angela. Already knew some basics of python and was a nice refresher. Day 1 includes print, input statements and string manipulation. Also, did the practice exercises on [repl.it](https://replit.com/~). The projectt on day-1 encompasses all the concepts taught before and has set a starting point. Today I also studied some freecodecamp [python lectures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) by Prof. Charles Severence. 

### Day - 2
**Thoughts** : Today I learned about data types, mathematical operations and some string manipulation and f strings. Build a BMI calculator and life in weeks(a slightly dark project) program. The project of the day was Tip calculator which also takes in account what percent of bill you want to tip. Also practiced some python exercises from [Pynative](https://pynative.com/python-basic-exercise-for-beginners/) which tested some the concepts I learned earlier.

### Day - 3
**Thoughts** : Angela started with control flow with if-else loops and went on to practice abundant exercises. Learnt more about nested if-else loops, updated yesterday's BMI calculator. Also developed Pizza Order prize calculator and love calculator based on Buzzfeed's [article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ariannarebolini/what-are-the-chances-your-crush-is-actually-your-true-love). And then went on to develop the treasure island project which includes nice ascii art.

### Day - 4
**Thoughts** : Learned about Random function today in Python. Did you knew that python uses Mersenne Twister behind the scenes for random function, Interesting! [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) it's wiki. Build some easy yet fun exercises like head-tails game, banker's roulette which is an interesting game among the indigeneous London bankers. Finally, created a rock, paper, scissor game which has ascii art and random choice by computer.

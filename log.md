### Day - 1
**Thoughts** : Started out with the 100 days of code [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Angela. Already knew some basics of python and was a nice refresher. Day 1 includes print, input statements and string manipulation. Also, did the practice exercises on [repl.it](https://replit.com/~). The projectt on day-1 encompasses all the concepts taught before and has set a starting point. Today I also studied some freecodecamp [python lectures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) by Prof. Charles Severence. 

### Day - 2
**Thoughts** : Today I learned about data types, mathematical operations and some string manipulation and f strings. Build a BMI calculator and life in weeks(a slightly dark project) program. The project of the day was Tip calculator which also takes in account what percent of bill you want to tip. Also practiced some python exercises from [Pynative](https://pynative.com/python-basic-exercise-for-beginners/) which tested some the concepts I learned earlier.

### Day - 3
**Thoughts** : Angela started with control flow with if-else loops and went on to practice abundant exercises. Learnt more about nested if-else loops, updated yesterday's BMI calculator. Also developed Pizza Order prize calculator and love calculator based on Buzzfeed's [article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ariannarebolini/what-are-the-chances-your-crush-is-actually-your-true-love). And then went on to develop the treasure island project which includes nice ascii art.

### Day - 4
**Thoughts** : Learned about Random function today in Python. Did you knew that python uses Mersenne Twister behind the scenes for random function, Interesting! [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) it's wiki. Build some easy yet fun exercises like head-tails game, banker's roulette which is an interesting game among the indigeneous London bankers. Finally, created a rock, paper, scissor game which has ascii art and random choice by computer. 

### Day - 5
**Thoughts** : Day-5 started with loops in python, particularly for loops. The first exercise was for calculating average height using for loop. The next exercise was based on range function of for loops which was to calculate even numbers addition. Angela introduced an interview question FizzBuzz which I found out to be relatively easy. Finally, created a random password generator which takes input for characters, numbers and special symbols. Finally, concluded the day with some light practice freom [w3 resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php) for python.  

### Day - 6
**Thoughts** :  Today started by learning about creating, defining and calling *functions*. The first exercise was hurdles in [reeborg's world](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html). Thsese are a set of fascinating exercise which will test and help you with learning loops and functions in python. Then learned about while loops in python and did 2 more exercises on reeborg's world. The final project is about navigating reeborg along a maze with some conditions and actions to be performed. Also tested some edge cases where the code fails and fixed it with some help from Angela.

### Day - 7
**Thoughts** : Day - 7 exercises were different as compared to earlier day's exercises. On day 7 we built a *hangman* game and go on building it in steps; essentially breaking a bigger problem into finite easier exercises. Hangman game is a very good tester project to gauge the skills learned so far. Hangman game is an exciting game which also includes ascii art. :heart:

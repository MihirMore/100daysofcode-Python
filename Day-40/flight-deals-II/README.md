**Description** : This project is a capstone project wherein we develop a Flight application which will send us notifications when flight prices are less then we have entered for the next six months. This application uses Sheety API to read/write data stored in our google sheets. Also, we have used Tequila by kiwi API to fetch IATA codes for destination cities as well as to fetch flight data. We have created a customer acquisition console application where users have to enter their emails and will recieve flight deals via email :airplane:

## Printing to the Console

# Instructions

Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function. 

**Warning:** The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.

# Example Output

After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:

```
Day 1 - Python Print Function
```

```
The function is declared like this:
```

```
print('what to print')
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

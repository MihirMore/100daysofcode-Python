# List Comprehension 2

## Instructions

You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called result. This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers.

DO NOT modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

```text

Example Output
[2, 8, 34]
```

Hint
Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

Remind yourself of how the modulo operator works.

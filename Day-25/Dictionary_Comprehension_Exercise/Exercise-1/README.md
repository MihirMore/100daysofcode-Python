# Dictionary Comprehension 1

## Instructions

You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result that takes each word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.

Try Googling to find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.

Do NOT Create a dictionary directly. Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop.

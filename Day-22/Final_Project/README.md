**Description** : Pong game was originally developed by Atari and released in 1972 created by Allan Alcorn. This game gained a lot of popularity amongst bars and clubs. I have implemented a simple version of it here. This game has been created by using Turtle graphics, hope you enjoy it! :sparkles:

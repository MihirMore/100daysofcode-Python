# Decorators

## Instructions

time.time() will return the current time in seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00

Try running the starting code to see the current time printed.

If you run the code after a while, you'll see a new time printed.

e.g. first run:

1598524371.736911

second run:

1598524436.357875

The time difference = second run - first run

64.62096405029297

(approx 1 minute)

Given the above information, complete the code exercise by printing out the speed it takes to run the fast_function() vs the slow_function(). You will need to complete the speed_calc_decorator() function.

HINT: You can use function.__name__ to get the name of the function,
